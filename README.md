# Old Hollywood (1930-1960) movie recommender system
After selecting a movie from a list of the top 20 most-rated movies on IMDB \[7\] of the 21st century (as of 2017), this recommender recommends 5 Old Hollywood movies based on similarities of the movies' Wikipedia plots \[1\]\[4\]\[5\]\[6\], VADER sentiment analysis scores, genres, and IMDB movie ratings.

This project was inspired by the Gutenberg book recommender system built by James LeDoux, Drew Hoo, and Aniket Saoji \[2\] as well as Dhilip Subramanian's TDS article \[3\].
