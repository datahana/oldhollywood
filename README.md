# Old Hollywood (1930-1960) movie recommender system
After selecting a movie from a list of the top 20 most-rated movies on IMDB of the 21st century (as of 2017), this recommender recommends 5 Old Hollywood movies based on similarities of the movies' Wikipedia plots, VADER sentiment analysis scores, genres, and IMDB movie ratings.

This project was inspired by the Gutenberg book recommender system built by James LeDoux, Drew Hoo, and Aniket Saoji.
